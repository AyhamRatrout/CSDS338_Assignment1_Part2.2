# CSDS338_Assignment1_Part2.2

This repository contains my implementation of a simple C program that prints all the integers from 1 to 10, their squares, and their factorials in a table with rows and 3 columns, using printf. The instructions for this task were: "Show your c programming skill to print all of the integers from 1 to 10, their squares, and their factorials in a table with rows and 3 columns, using printf. You do not have to write a factorial subroutine but you are welcome to."

This task is part of my very first assignment for my Intro to Operating Systems and Concurrent Programming class. The goal of this task is to get students started with programming in C and become familiar with the syntax for it is one of the very needed skills when learning operating systems using Linux. It also provides a gentle introduction to C as this language is not one that is taught at my college (all of our college courses are based on Java).

Thanks,
Ayham R.
